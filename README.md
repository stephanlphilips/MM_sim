# Micromagnet simulator
Small simulator written in c/python to simulate micromagnet designs for spin qubit chips.


## Requirements:
Linux/Os X : gcc/python (>3.7)
<br/>
Windows : visual studio build tools (c++ libs)/python (>3.7)

## Installation:
The installation is done by a setup.py file, move to the cloned repository and run:
and run:
```bash
python setup.py install
```
to install the packages.

## Background
code is based on :
Goldman, J. R., et al. "Magnet designs for a crystal-lattice quantum computer." Applied Physics A 71.1 (2000): 11-17.
